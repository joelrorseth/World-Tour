 ### Overview
 
 In this playground, we will get our hands dirty building and visualizing the
 operation of a **genetic algorithm**. To provide a problem for which we may use a
 genetic algorithm to solve, we will pose the famous **Travelling Salesman Problem**,
 and solve it using this advanced search strategy.

 ## Travelling Salesman Problem
 
 In theoretical computer science, the **Travelling Salesman Problem** is one of the most
 famous optimization problems, dating back to the 1800's. The problem presents a salesman,
 who must travel to a finite number of cities. Given the distances between all pairs of
 cities, the solution must determine the shortest route connecting all cities. The problem
 is classified as [NP-Hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness), meaning that
 algorithmic computation for non-trivial route sizes is generally infeasible. Thus, most
 common known *solutions* are approximations, which aim to optimize and search for
 increasingly optimal solutions.
